# Heart Disease Prediction Pipeline

## Overview
This project is a cloud-ready data science and machine learning application for predicting heart disease from patient attributes. It includes:

- a **data pipeline** for ingestion, preprocessing, EDA, reporting, and DataOps scheduling
- a **machine learning pipeline** for model preparation, training, evaluation, and metric logging
- a **Prefect API details script** that retrieves flow and deployment information

**Business problem:** predict whether a patient is likely to have heart disease so healthcare teams can support earlier risk identification.

**Dataset:** `data/heart.csv` with 918 records and the attributes provided in the assignment brief.

## How the Entire Project Works
At a high level, the project runs in four stages:

1. **Data ingestion and preprocessing**: `pipeline/data_pipeline.py` loads `data/heart.csv`, checks missing values, imputes numeric features, encodes categorical data, normalizes numeric features, and records summary statistics.
2. **EDA and reporting**: the same data pipeline computes correlations, age binning, categorical cross-tabs, feature importance, and saves charts plus a structured JSON report into `deployment/`.
3. **Model training and monitoring**: `pipeline/ml_pipeline.py` trains Logistic Regression and Random Forest models, evaluates them on a 70/30 split, logs metrics to MLflow, and saves the best model into `models/`.
4. **Serving and application access**: `api_details.py` uses Prefect APIs to display flow and deployment information for DataOps evidence.

In the cloud deployment, Prefect runs the data pipeline on a **3-minute schedule** and MLflow stores model metrics.

## Technology Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Prefect
- MLflow

## Local Setup
1. Create a virtual environment.
2. Activate it.
3. Install dependencies.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run the Project Locally

### 1. Run the data pipeline
This performs ingestion, preprocessing, EDA, feature analysis, visualization, and artifact generation.

```bash
python3 pipeline/data_pipeline.py
```

Generated outputs:
- `deployment/heart_processed.csv`
- `deployment/data_pipeline_report.json`
- `deployment/Age_hist.png`
- `deployment/Cholesterol_hist.png`
- `deployment/FastingBS_hist.png`
- `deployment/MaxHR_hist.png`
- `deployment/RestingBP_hist.png`
- `deployment/age_chol_scatter.png`

### 2. Run the machine learning pipeline
This trains two classification models, evaluates them, logs metrics to MLflow, and stores the best model.

```bash
python3 pipeline/ml_pipeline.py
```

Generated outputs:
- `models/model.pkl`
- `models/metrics_report.json`
- MLflow tracking data in `mlruns/`
- MLflow local metadata database in `mlflow.db`

### 3. Start the supporting services
Start Prefect so the flow and deployment can be monitored from a dashboard.

```bash
prefect server start --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4200
```

In a second terminal, register and serve the scheduled data pipeline every 3 minutes.

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
PREFECT_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4200/api python3 pipeline/data_pipeline.py --serve
```

Optional: start MLflow UI.

```bash
mlflow ui --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5000
```

Where to view the dashboards locally:
- Prefect dashboard: `http://127.0.0.1:4200`
- MLflow UI: `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

### 4. Retrieve application details through APIs
This script uses Prefect's built-in client APIs to retrieve application metadata.

```bash
PREFECT_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4200/api python3 api_details.py
```

The script displays at least two application details such as:
- flow count
- deployment count
- flow ID and flow name
- deployment ID and deployment name

## Cloud Execution Guide

To run the application on a cloud or on-premises Linux machine:

**[→ See Rocky Linux Deployment Guide](ROCKY_LINUX_DEPLOYMENT.md)** — Complete step-by-step instructions for Rocky Linux, CentOS, or any RHEL-based system with automated and manual deployment options.

### Cloud Architecture

The application runs on a single Linux VM with three persistent services:

- **Prefect Server** (port 4200) — Orchestration engine and dashboard for monitoring
- **Data Pipeline Service** — Scheduled every 3 minutes via Prefect
- **MLflow UI** (port 5000) — Model metrics tracking and visualization

### Quick Cloud Deployment

For automated setup on Rocky Linux:

```bash
sudo bash setup_rocky_linux.sh
```

This handles all installation, configuration, and service startup automatically (~10-15 minutes total).

For step-by-step manual deployment, see [ROCKY_LINUX_DEPLOYMENT.md](ROCKY_LINUX_DEPLOYMENT.md).

### Access Cloud Dashboards

After deployment completes:

- **Prefect Dashboard:** http://<instance-ip>:4200
- **MLflow UI:** http://<instance-ip>:5000

### Verify Cloud Deployment

```bash
# SSH into your cloud instance
ssh user@instance-ip

# Verify services are running
sudo systemctl status prefect-server.service data-pipeline.service mlflow-ui.service

# Retrieve application details via Prefect APIs
cd /opt/heart-disease-ml
source venv/bin/activate
PREFECT_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4200/api python3 api_details.py
```

### Monitor Cloud Pipelines

```bash
# View live Prefect server logs
sudo journalctl -u prefect-server.service -f

# View scheduled pipeline execution
sudo journalctl -u data-pipeline.service -f

# View MLflow server logs
sudo journalctl -u mlflow-ui.service -f
```

### Cloud Artifacts

After deployment, you will see:

- **Prefect Dashboard** showing the `heart-dataops-3min` deployment with 3-minute runs
- **MLflow Dashboard** showing both trained models and their metrics
- **Generated data artifacts** in `/opt/heart-disease-ml/deployment/`
- **Generated model artifacts** in `/opt/heart-disease-ml/models/`
